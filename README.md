# uuid

**Version 4.0.x is a complete redesign of the underlying setup, but tries to be API compatible or similar to 3.x.**

**UuidValue is still Experimental and the API for it is in flux, please pay attention to changelogs and versions.**

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Daegalus/dart-uuid/workflows/Dart/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/Daegalus/dart-uuid/actions)

Simple, fast generation of [RFC4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUIDs.

Features:

* Generate RFC4122 version 1, version 4, or version 5 UUIDs
* Supports draft version 6, version 7, and version 8
* Runs in web, server, and flutter
* Cryptographically strong random number generation on all platforms
  * **Defaults to non-crypto generator, see UuidUtil for cryptoRNG**
* [Documentation](https://daegalus.github.io/dart-uuid/index.html)

## Getting Started

### Instructions

1. Open a command line and cd to your projects root folder
2. In your pubspec, add an entry for dart-uuid to your dependencies (example below)
3. pub install
4. If you wish to run tests, go into packages/dart-uuid/ and run 'dart test/uuid_test.dart'

### Pubspec

There are 2 options. Directly from git, or from pub.dartlang.org

pub.dartlang.org: (you can use 'any' instead of a version if you just want the latest always)

```yaml
dependencies:
  uuid: ^4.0.0-beta1
```

```dart
import 'package:uuid/uuid.dart';

var uuid = Uuid();
```

Then create some ids ...

```dart
// Generate a v1 (time-based) id
uuid.v1(); // -> '6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a'

// Generate a v4 (random) id
uuid.v4(); // -> '110ec58a-a0f2-4ac4-8393-c866d813b8d1'

// Generate a v5 (namespace-name-sha1-based) id
uuid.v5(Uuid.NAMESPACE_URL, 'www.google.com'); // -> 'c74a196f-f19d-5ea9-bffd-a2742432fc9c'
```
